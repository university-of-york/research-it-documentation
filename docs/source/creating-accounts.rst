Creating an Account
===================

Getting access to Viking is a simple two-stage process:

1. The principal investigator (PI) of a project completes the `project application form <https://goo.gl/forms/xlSrWsP0QaT7PYpm2>`_. Once approved, the PI will be assigned a ``project code`` to distribute to members of the project.
2. Members can then use this ``project code`` to complete the `user application form <https://goo.gl/forms/0Uhl5sIOhFlYtZc63>`_. The PI will be notified each time a user account is assigned to the project.


Project Application
===================
In order to use Viking, the project PI (or supervisor) must apply for a Viking project account. These will be used to monitor the usage of Viking, and attribute its use by researchers across the University. We ask that the PI who applies for the account is a permanent member of staff, as this will allow us to have a permanent contact for project reporting purposes. You may also nominate a deputy, who can deal with any project enquiries on your behalf. **Only the project PI should submit project application forms**. A PI may request more than one project code, for multiple projects.

Once the application has been approved, a new Viking project code will be supplied to you. You should then distribute the project code to all research team members, before they apply for user accounts.

`The Project Application Form can be found here <https://goo.gl/forms/xlSrWsP0QaT7PYpm2>`_.

User Account Application
========================
Each user on Viking must apply for an individual user account and all user accounts are associated with at least one project group. In order to complete the user account application form, **you must have a valid project code**. If you are unsure what your project code is, you should contact your PI (or supervisor) who should be able to supply you with a suitable project code or request a new one by completing the project application form.
