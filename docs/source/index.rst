**Viking** is a large, Linux compute cluster with many nodes, CPUs, GPUs, lots of storage and boat loads of memory. Viking is housed in Sweden (of course!) in the forward thinking `EcoDataCentre <https://ecodatacenter.tech/>`_, which is one of the most sustainable data centres in the whole world. üåçü•∞

Check out the :doc:`getting_started/quickstart` section for a speedy guide to getting started or for a more in depth guide, start with the :doc:`getting_started/creating-accounts` page.

If you are brand new to using the Linux commands line then how about a quick tutorial from Ubuntu called `The Linux command line for beginners <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview>`_ or have a read of our own :doc:`beginners guide to the Linux shell </beginners_guide/linux-shell>`.


.. hint::

   In the examples of the Viking command line which we show here they will all begin with the dollar symbol ``$``, you don't need to copy this it's just there to help show you that it's a command prompt we are describing. For example you'll see things like this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ module spider Python
