Specific application guides
===========================

Here we will share some guides on getting started with some specific applications. In many cases there are multiple ways to accomplish things so you can treat these pages as a starting point. If you found a good guide elsewhere which you successfully followed or if you would like your own guide added please feel free to `let us know <itsupport@york.ac.uk>`_.

.. note::

    Any included jobscripts are generic and so you will need to insert your specific details for them to function correctly.

.. tip::

    In each section there may be an example ``module load`` command. Newer versions of the applications may be available so please try the command ``module spider NAME`` where 'NAME' is the software to search for, and you will be presented with the currently available list.

.. place any *.rst file in this `applications` folder and it will be 'globbed' by the `toctree` directive below

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:

   ./*
