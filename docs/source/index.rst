Welcome to the Viking Documentation!
======================================

.. caution::

   This project is under active development.

**Viking** is a large, Linux compute cluster with many nodes, CPUs, GPUs, lots of storage and boat loads of memory. Viking is housed in Sweden (of course!) in the forward thinking `EcoDataCentre <https://ecodatacenter.tech/>`_, which is one of the most sustainable data centres in the whole world. üåçü•∞
