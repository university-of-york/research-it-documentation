Backing up your data
====================

There are two main options depending on how frequently you need to access the data, the University **Filestore** or the **Vault**.

The :doc:`Vault </data_management/vault>` provides unlimited cold storage and is appropriate for storing sensitive data but retrieving the data can take some time and may incur a charge

The :doc:`Filestore </data_management/filestore>` is more readily accessible, if you need more space please contact itsupport@york.ac.uk. If you use the Filestore for backing up, usually the data will be transferred to the Vault for archiving later.

Other options are available, please browse through the **DATA MANAGEMENT** section in the main navigation menu to see some common examples.

.. warning::

    Please ensure you **regularly** back up your data, if there is a catastrophic failure all data on Viking could be lost!
