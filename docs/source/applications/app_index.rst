Specific application guides
===========================

Here we will share some guides on getting started with some specific applications. In many cases there are multiple ways to accomplish things so you can treat these pages as a starting point. If you found a good guide elsewhere which you successfully followed or if you would like your own guide added please feel free to `let us know <itsupport@york.ac.uk>`_.
