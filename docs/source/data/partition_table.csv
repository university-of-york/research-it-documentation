preempt,30 days,No limit,No limit,No limit,1,4.8 GB,170,"**Warning:** jobs submitted to this partition are subject to **preemption**. |br| There is no guarantee when or if a job will run, or whether it will complete. |br| This partition has no limits on the resources that can be requested, but a |br| lower priority than the nodes partition. Jobs will run if there are free resources |br| in the nodes partition, but will be cancelled if these resources are later required |br| for another higher priority job."
himem,48 hrs,No limit,288,3.78 TB,1,11.875 GB,4,"Partition for running jobs that require memory greater than that available in other |br| partitions. Three nodes (himem02, himem04 and himem05) have 64 cores, one node |br| (himem01) has 96 cores. The max running cores and max running memory limits are |br| practical limits, due to the resources available on the nodes."
