Vault
=====

Vault is a file archiving service.  It can be used to store files that need to be kept, but are unlikely to be accessed again.  The main use is for storing research data which needs to be kept for contractual or other reasons, but is probably never going to be used or looked at again. Please see the `Vault User Guide <https://support.york.ac.uk/s/article/Vault-User-Guide>`_ for more details.
