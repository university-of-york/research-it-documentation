nodes,48 hrs,No Limit,500,2.4 TB,1,4.8 GB,170,"Default partition for everything - due to the the 500 core per user limit, there is a practical job limit of 500 running jobs, assuming 1 core per job. There is also a limit of 2.4TB in total."
test,30 mins,2 running |br| 4 total,8,16 GB,1,1 GB,170,Partition for testing small jobs. Request using --partition=test in job script.
preempt,30 days,No limit,No limit,No limit,1,4.8 GB,170,"Warning: jobs submitted to this partition are subject to preemption. There is no guarantee when or if a job will run, or whether it will complete. This partition has no limits on the resources that can be requested, but a lower priority than the nodes partition. Jobs will run if there are free resources in the nodes partition, but will be cancelled if these resources are later required for another higher priority job. Need to request using --partition=preempt in job script."
himem,48 hrs,No limit,288,3.78 TB,1,11.875 GB,4,"Partition for running jobs that require memory greater than that available in other partitions. Need to request using --partition=himem in job script. Three nodes (himem02, himem04 and himem05) have 64 cores, one node (himem01) has 96 cores. The max running cores and max running memory limits are practical limits, due to the resources available on the nodes."
himem_week,7 days,No limit,64,760 GB,1,11.875 GB,1,"Partition for running jobs that require memory greater than that available in other partitions. Need to request using --partition=himem_week in job script. The max running cores and max running memory limits are practical limits, due to the resources available on the nodes."
gpu,72 hrs,No limit,40,384 GB,1,9.6 GB,2,"Partition for running jobs that require GPUs, see documentation for details about how to request GPUs. There are 4 GPUs and 40 cores on each GPU node, subject to the following rules: Your job script must request at least one GPU You can request a maximum of 10 cores per GPU You can use no more than 2 GPUs at a time across all of your jobs running in the GPU partition"
week,7 days,No limit,400,1.92 TB,1,4.75 GB,10,"Partition for jobs that need to run for longer than the 48h max time allowed by the nodes partition, but for less than a week. Need to request using --partition=week in job script. The max running cores and max running memory limits are practical limits, due to the resources available on the nodes."
month,30 days,No limit,120,575 GB,1,4.75 GB,3,"Partition for jobs that need to run for longer than the 7 day max time allowed by the week partition, but for less than 30 days. Need to request using --partition=month in job script. The max running cores and max running memory limits are practical limits, due to the resources available on the nodes."
interactive,8 hrs,1,1,19258M,1,9629M,1,Partition for jobs that would like to use Viking interactively.  This could be used for graphical work with the 8 hr queue limit set to mimic a working day.  Need to request using --partition=interactive.
